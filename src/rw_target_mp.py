    ----------
    G : networkx.DiGraph
        A directed graph with edge weights used as transition probabilities.
    source : node
        Starting node for the random walk.

    Run random walk simulations for all target nodes in G from a given source 
    node and save the results as a json file.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    G : networkx.DiGraph
        A directed graph with edge weights used as transition probabilities 
        (unless `uniform_rw` is True).
    source : node
        Starting node for the random walk.
    output_dir : str
        Directory to save the output json file with name <source>.json.
    uniform_rw : bool
        Whether to use uniform random walk instead of biasing the walk
        transition probabilities using edge weights in G. Defaults to False,

        Note that these are "attemped" paths to target â€” not all paths end at
